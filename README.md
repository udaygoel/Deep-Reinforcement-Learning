# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

Here you can find several projects covering various algorithms and implementations for deep reinforcement learning applications. These projects were developed as part of the [Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893). 



## Projects

You can view and launch the following projects:

- [Navigation - Value based methods](https://github.com/udaygoel/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/tree/master/Navigation%20-%20Value%20based%20methods)

  This project trains an agent to navigate in a large, square world and collect bananas using Value based methods such as Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN), Double DQN (DDQN) and Prioritized Experience Reply. The Project runs through each step in detail. The objective of the agent is to receive an average reward of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.
